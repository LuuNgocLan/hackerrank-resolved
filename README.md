# 💻✨ HackerRank Practice - Code like a Cool Data Scientist 💡📊
Welcome to my HackerRank Practice repo! 🚀 I'm on a mission to sharpen my SQL skills for data science while keeping things fun with my love for Kotlin. Whether you're into data, coding, or just want to explore some cool projects, feel free to dive in and explore! 😎

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm passionate about all things data science and absolutely in love with Kotlin (it's my coding love language 💕). This repo is where I practice solving coding challenges to prep for the exciting world of data science and keep my skills sharp.

## 🔥 What You'll Find Here
#### SQL Mastery for Data Science:
🛠️ My journey through SQL challenges designed to sharpen my query-fu, including data manipulation, joins, aggregations, and complex queries. 📊

### Kotlin for the Win
💖 My love for Kotlin knows no bounds. While SQL is all about data, I also practice some good ol' Kotlin here for coding challenges and logic problems. It's my coding playground!

### 🌟 Why SQL?
SQL is the backbone of data analysis and data science. I'll be using it to:

- 🔍 Query, analyze, and manipulate data like a pro.
- 💡 Answer business questions and extract meaningful insights.
- 📈 Build my foundation for more advanced tools like pandas and Spark in Python.
- 💾 This is my go-to section for all things data!

## 🚀 Why Kotlin?
Because coding can be efficient AND beautiful. Kotlin is:

- 🦄 Modern, expressive, and concise.
- 💻 My go-to language for problem-solving (I mean, why not code in style?).
- 🤖 Great for building logic and practicing algorithms. Who says data science can’t have some functional programming fun?

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Using
- HackerRank: For practicing SQL queries and logic problems.
- Kotlin: For coding fun and improving my problem-solving skills.
- VSCode: My editor of choice because it's simple but powerful (and I have a dark theme to match my cool dev vibes 😎).

## 💡 How to Use This Repo
1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuuNgocLan/hackerrank-resolved.git
```
2. Browse through the folders:

- SQL: All SQL practice problems and solutions.
- Kotlin: Coding challenges solved with Kotlin, from algorithms to data structure puzzles.

3. Run and Learn:

- Each folder contains README files for specific challenges to explain what I'm working on and how the solution was crafted.
- SQL solutions are provided in .sql format, and Kotlin in .kt format for easy use.

## 🎯 What's Next?
I'm on a journey to dive deeper into:

- Advanced SQL: Time to tackle some complex queries and optimize performance!
- Kotlin for Data Science: Combining Kotlin with data science tools (yes, Kotlin isn’t just for Android apps 🦸‍♀️).
- Machine Learning: The ultimate goal. SQL is just the start, but data science + machine learning is where I’m heading!

## 👑 Cool Girl Vibes
I believe in coding with confidence, learning with passion, and breaking stereotypes along the way. If you're looking for a mix of serious coding and playful vibes, this is the place to be! 💅💻
